KEGS - Kent's Emulated GS
=========================

Kegs is an Apple //gs emulator for Mac OS X, Win32, Linux and Unix/X11

The latest version on the main KEGS home page is v0.91 which doesn't work on Intel Macs. In fact, only
small build changes are required, so I have forked the code to Github with my changes.

Original homepage with useful info on how to get it running is here: (http://kegs.sourceforge.net/)[http://kegs.sourceforge.net/]
